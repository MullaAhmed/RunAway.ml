# Project RunAwayML

Welcome to the **Project RunAwayML** GitHub repository! This repository is intented to host a collection of interesting AI applications in the form of easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files and Google Colab links. The aim of this project is to provide accessible and user-friendly AI applications that anyone can explore and utilize.

## About

In today's digital era, there is a vast availability of AI applications online, often provided as open-source software. However, many of these applications go unused by individuals due to the complexities involved in setting them up and understanding their intricacies. Consequently, they are often sold as services, just by making them more accessible & easy to understand.

**Project RunAwayML** seeks to bridge this gap by offering AI applications in a user-friendly format. By providing easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook files and Google Colab links, it strives to make AI more approachable to a wider audience. It focuses on eliminating the barriers that hinder individuals from leveraging the power of AI.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows, with each subdirectory representing a unique AI application:

- `/avatar-generator`: Contains the necessary files and instructions to use the Avatar Generator application. This application utilizes stable diffusion to generate customizable avatars, similar to Lensa. Explore the contents of this directory to get started with the Avatar Generator.

To use any of the applications, follow the instructions provided within the respective subdirectory. The instructions will guide you through the setup and execution of the AI application, allowing you to explore its features and functionality.

Feel free to navigate through the subdirectories to discover various AI applications and their corresponding resources. Each application is designed to be easily understood and used, eliminating the complexity that often discourages people from harnessing the potential of AI.

Happy exploring and experimenting with the different AI applications in this repository!

## Getting Started

To get started with **Project RunAwayML**, follow these steps:

1. Browse the `.ipynb` files in the directory to find the AI application that interests you.
2. Download the subdirectory to your local machine.
3. Open the downloaded file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to run and explore the AI application.

Alternatively, you can choose to use Google Colab for a hassle-free experience:

1. Use the `colab link` in `readme.md` file in each subdirectory of AI application you wish to explore.
2. The link will open the notebook directly in Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run and interact with the AI application.
